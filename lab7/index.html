    <h2>Challenges:</h2>
      <p> Couldn't figure out how to do the namebadge thing myself, which is kind of dissappointing? If I had given myself more time I know I could've probably figured it out. </p>
    <h2>Results:</h2> 
      <p> More practice with JS! I'm kind of getting the hang of out, but I wish the screenshots weren't holding my hand so much. I need to study outside of class. Kariya's been great too! helped me alot on the last couple of labs and has been setting up the google docs. </p>
