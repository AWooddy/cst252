		<h2>Challenges:</h2>
			<p> Didn't struggle with this much at all. Just had to re-read everything and make sure I am properly following the instructions given to me.  </p>
		<h2>Results:</h2> 
			<p> Played around with the CSS alittle bit and wanted to add a shake image, it worked and I am greatly pleased. Doing JSON for the first time in awhile was also really cool! I got the shake code mostly from W3 schools and hope I credited them properly in my CSS code. </p>
