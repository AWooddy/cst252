   <h2> Subject: To do an input field and test a button click event. </h2>
    <h2> Problems: I don't think I really understand how to prompt the button to do the output part? </h2>
    <h2>Challenges: </h2>
      <p> Need to figure out how to do the output correctly, will ask in class tomorrow and my partner. I tried Kariya's method but it also wouldn't work in mine, so I tried refering the screenshot from the lecture and it still doesn't prompt the output? </p>
    <h2>Results: </h2> 
      <p> Well, the button sure is there I suppose. </p>
