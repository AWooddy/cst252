    <h2> Problems: Mostly just had to reference alot from my partner's stuff and the original assigment and look some stuff up using the console errors to see what went wrong. </h2>
    <h2>Challenges: </h2>
      <p> I can't seem to figure out how to do the whole javascript into css thing? so hopefully after a few more tries something will work.  </p>
    <h2>Results: </h2> 
      <p> It's working so i guess that is pretty cool? I had to reference the net for some issues i was having.. such as putting document.getElementbyID when you it's case senstivie and thats just not a thing.  </p>
