   <h1> Lab 3 File Structures </h1>
     <p> To learn about and create file structures. We also added index files to our files and put them in use. </p>

       <h2> Challenges </h2>
       <p> Nothing was terribly challenging. I just haven't taken a coding class in a year and ahalf so i'm super rusty on the basics right now! </p>

       <h2> Results </h2>
       <p> Hopefully this shows up and everything is running correctly! Also helped me shove a image somewhere which is fun. </p>
